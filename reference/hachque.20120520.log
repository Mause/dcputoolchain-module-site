01[20:08] <Lord_DeathMatch> for the link i sent you :P the one to upload modules :P
01[20:08] <Lord_DeathMatch> http://irc.lysdev.com:8080/modules/add
[20:09] <hachque> ah okay
[20:09] <hachque> well it's open source, so there's no point having a password
[20:09] <hachque> modules interface should just be HTTP-only
[20:09] <hachque> *modules add interface
[20:09] <hachque> like you did with the search form
01[20:11] <Lord_DeathMatch> what, as opposed to https?
01[20:11] <Lord_DeathMatch> theres no javascript or anything like that
01[20:11] <Lord_DeathMatch> its python
[20:12] <hachque> nah I mean
[20:12] <hachque> d/w about providing a programmable interface to add modules
[20:12] <hachque> it's not needed
[20:12] <hachque> only need programmable interfaces for install/remove/search
01[20:13] <Lord_DeathMatch> righteo
01[20:13] <Lord_DeathMatch> though im apprehensive of proving a free-for-all remove interface :P
01[20:13] <Lord_DeathMatch> *providing
01[20:25] <Lord_DeathMatch> hachque: anything special for 'install'? or do you mean just serving the file?
[20:25] <hachque> just serve the file
[20:25] <hachque> and you don't need to do anything for remove
[20:25] <hachque> since that's all local
01[20:25] <Lord_DeathMatch> oh, righteo
01[20:25] <Lord_DeathMatch> cool
01[20:26] <Lord_DeathMatch> hachque: do we want to be able to search the contents of the files too?
[20:26] <hachque> aww
[20:26] <hachque> not really
[20:26] <hachque> although
[20:26] <hachque> it would be good if you could evaluate the file in Lua
[20:26] <hachque> and then pull out the module information
[20:26] <hachque> so they could search by module name
01[20:27] <Lord_DeathMatch> yeah, i dont know how well that would go down in python though
01[20:29] <Lord_DeathMatch> well what do you know: http://code.google.com/p/slpp/
01[20:29] <Lord_DeathMatch> huh
