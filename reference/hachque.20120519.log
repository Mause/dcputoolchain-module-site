01[18:17] <Lord_DeathMatch> hi :)
[18:17] <hachque> can you set up some kind of online module system?
01[18:18] <Lord_DeathMatch> how do you mean?
[18:18] <hachque> just a repository that can be queried for modules
[18:18] <hachque> like
[18:18] <hachque> /modules/search?q=blah
[18:18] <hachque> returns the result as just newline-seperated results
[18:18] <hachque> and then
[18:18] <hachque> /modules/download?name=blah
[18:18] <hachque> would give the lua script
01[18:18] <Lord_DeathMatch> yeah, i can do that
01[18:18] <Lord_DeathMatch> easy wnough
01[18:18] <Lord_DeathMatch> *enough
[18:19] <hachque> later on we could make it so that people could upload their own scripts to the repo
[18:19] <hachque> but initially we just need that
01[18:19] <Lord_DeathMatch> im not doing anything tonight, i can write a prototype
[18:19] <hachque> kk, that would be cool
[18:19] <hachque> also
01[18:19] <Lord_DeathMatch> yeah?
[18:19] <hachque> do you want to remove the documentation compilation steps in build_for_windows
[18:19] <hachque> since build_for_linux already does that
[18:19] <hachque> no point doing it twice
01[18:20] <Lord_DeathMatch> yeah, but is it possible to add a make command that just builds the documentation
01[18:20] <Lord_DeathMatch> ?
01[18:20] <Lord_DeathMatch> then i put into a seperate factoy
01[18:20] <Lord_DeathMatch> *i can
[18:20] <hachque> I was more thinking that since both jobs will the built as new commits come in
01[18:21] <Lord_DeathMatch> fair enough :)
01[18:21] <Lord_DeathMatch> ill do it now
[18:21] <hachque> awesome
